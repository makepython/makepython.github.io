# Objective

The goal is to gather people interested in advanced python concepts that go
beyond the language.  We want to focus on environment, advanced programming
techniques, useful libraries, and integration with a larger infrastructure
(e.g. SQL databases, cloud, etc.).

The format is not strictly a presentation. While some slides may be used to
introduce the topic, the idea is that we explore the topic, make mistakes, do
experiments, read the code and the documentation. It is not a lesson. It is a
shared tinkering and practice session.

# Recommended laptop setup

- Bring your laptop with a working python 3.x installation.
- Any operating system is ok. Diversity on this front allows us to 
  discuss platform differences. Linux, Windows, macOS are all welcome.
- A text editor or IDE. Vim, emacs, PyCharm, notepad++, Visual Studio...
- Jupyter environments are tailored for a different type of prototyping, and
  are therefore not well suited.

If you need assistance on any of the points above, let someone know and we'll be
happy to help.

Be aware that, like every tinkering session, things can go wrong. Don't bring
the laptop and python environment required for your Ph.D thesis presentation 
on the next morning.

# Calendar

Gatherings happen the **first Thursday of the month** at 19:00. Meetings will last
as long as they need, but expect around one or two hours of tinkering and
discussion.

On the **third Thursday of the month**, a one-to-one meeting is generally
available for fixes, questions, code browsing, exchange of ideas, on a
first-come first-serve basis. The following dates are currently scheduled:
