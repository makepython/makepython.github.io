# Objective

The goal is to gather people interested in advanced python concepts that go
beyond the language.  We want to focus on environment, advanced programming
techniques, useful libraries, and integration with a larger infrastructure
(e.g. SQL databases, cloud, etc.).

The format is not strictly a presentation. While some slides may be used to
introduce the topic, the idea is that we explore the topic, make mistakes, do
experiments, read the code and the documentation. It is not a lesson. It is a
shared tinkering and practice session.

**Bring your laptop.**

# Calendar

Gatherings happen the first Thursday of the month at 19:00. Meetings will last
as long as they need, but expect around one or two hours of tinkering and
discussion.

If there's interest, an additional Thursday (third of the month) will be
scheduled. The following dates are currently scheduled:
